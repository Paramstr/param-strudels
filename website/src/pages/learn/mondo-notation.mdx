# Mondo Notation

"Mondo Notation" is a new kind of notation that is similar to [Mini Notation](/learn/mini-notation/), but with enough abilities to make it work as a standalone pattern language.
Here's an example:

<MiniRepl
  mondo
  client:idle
  tune={`n (irand 12.segment 8.ribbon 4 2)
.scale<C:minor F:minor>/2
.jux <rev (.slow 2)>/2
.rarely (12.note.add) .delay .4 .vib 1:.3
.fm (sine/4.range .5 4).fmh 2.02
.lpf (sine/2.range 200 2000).lpq 4
.s piano .clip 2
.add (perlin.range 0 .2 .note)`}
/>

## Calling Functions

Compared to Mini Notation, the most notable feature of Mondo Notation is the ability to call functions using round brackets:

<MiniRepl mondo client:idle tune={`(s hh*8)`} />

The first element inside the brackets is the function name. In JS, this would look like:

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`s("hh*8")`} />

The outermost parens are not needed, so we can drop them:

<MiniRepl mondo client:idle tune={`s hh*8`} />

## Mini Notation Features

Besides function calling with round parens, Mondo Notation has a lot in common with Mini Notation:

- `[]` for 1-cycle sequences
- `<>` for multi-cycle sequences
- `{}` for stepped sequences (more on that later)
- \* => [fast](/learn/time-modifiers/#fast)
- / => [slow](/learn/time-modifiers/#slow)
- , => [stack](/learn/factories/#stack)
- ! => [extend](/learn/stepwise/#extend)
- @ => [expand](/learn/stepwise/#expand)
- % => [pace](/learn/stepwise/#pace)
- ? => [degradeBy](/learn/random-modifiers/#degradeby) (currently requires right operand)
- : => tail (creates a list)
- .. => range (between numbers)
- | => [chooseIn](/learn/random-modifiers/#choose)

Example:

<MiniRepl
  mondo
  client:idle
  tune={`note <
[e5 [b4 c5] d5 [c5 b4]]
[a4 [a4 c5] e5 [d5 c5]]
[b4 [~ c5] d5 e5]
[c5 a4 a4 ~]
[[~ d5] [~ f5] a5 [g5 f5]]
[e5 [~ c5] e5 [d5 c5]]
[b4 [b4 c5] d5 e5]
[c5 a4 a4 ~]
>`}
/>

## Chaining Functions

Similar to how it works in JS, we can chain functions calls with the "." operator:

<MiniRepl
  mondo
  client:idle
  tune={`n <0 2 4 [3 1] -1>*4 
.scale C4:minor 
.jux rev 
.dec .2
.delay .5`}
/>

Here's the same written in JS:

<MiniRepl
  client:idle
  tune={`n("<0 2 4 [3 1] -1>*4")
.scale("C4:minor")
.jux(rev)
.dec(.2)
.delay(.5)`}
/>

### Chaining Functions Locally

A function can be applied "locally" by wrapping it in round parens:

<MiniRepl mondo client:idle tune={`s [bd hh bd cp.(delay .6)] .bank tr909`} />

in this case, `delay .6` will only be applied to `cp`. compare this with the JS version:

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`s(seq("bd", "hh", "bd", "cp".delay(.6))).bank('tr909')`} />

here we can see much we can save when there's no boundary between mini notation and function calls!

### Lambda Functions

Some functions in strudel expect a function as input, for example:

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`n("0 .. 7").scale("C:minor").sometimes(x=>x.dec(.1))`} />

in mondo, the `x=>x.` can be shortened to:

<MiniRepl client:idle mondo tune={`n 0..7 .scale C:minor .sometimes (.dec .1)`} />

chaining works as expected:

<MiniRepl client:idle mondo tune={`n 0..7 .scale C:minor .sometimes (.dec .1 .jux rev)`} />

## Strings

You can use "double quotes" and 'single quotes' to get a string:

<MiniRepl client:idle mondo tune={`n 0..7 .scale 'C minor'`} />

## Multiple Patterns

The `$` sign can be used to separate multiple patterns:

<MiniRepl
  client:idle
  mondo
  tune={`$ s [bd rim [- bd] rim] .bank tr707
$ chord <Dm9!3 Db7>.voicing
.struct[x - - x - x - -].delay.5`}
/>

The `$` sign is an alias for `,` so it will create a stack behind the scenes.
